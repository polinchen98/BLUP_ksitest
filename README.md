`matrix_T_np.py` - the file contains a function that creates a lower triangular matrix.

`matrix_T_inv_np.py` - the file contains a function that creates inverse matrix T.

`matrix_D_np.py` - the file contains a function that creates diagonal matrix.

`mixed_model_equations.py` - the file contains a function that find solution for mixed model equation.

`test.py` - script that runs the example from the book. The answer is the same:)
